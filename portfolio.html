            <p>Here's a game I made the art for. Sprites were made in Aseprite and backgrounds were made in PyxelEdit. Termina is still in the development process.

                    <h2>priorit-ease</h2>
                    <p>My first compsci project was called <br> priorit-EASE and the point was to help the user prioritize with ease. Source code is unavailable but the idea was that the user would enter a list of tasks and fill in a few variables and the program would output the most logical way of tackling that list of tasks.</p>

                    On a more serious note, I grabbed data from the Government of Canada's open data website about the percentage of French-speaking vs. English-speaking citizens in each province and visualized it in Processing.</p>
